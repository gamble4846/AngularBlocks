            1,
            Open Documentation and you'll see [Introduction, Getting Started, Installation, Inputs ....] are on location
            2, Open Inputs and you'll see [[(MenuModel)] ....] these are on location 3 and so on...</li>
          <li>IsOpen? - IsOpen is an optional boolean that specifies if the current menu is open or not meaning if the
            children of current menu is being displayed or not</li>
          <li>Id? - Id is an optional value that is unique for all the menu items, if you dont specify the id manually a

        <p>ShowOpenForAll is a boolean value used to specific if the open button (Down Caret on right side of the menu
          item) should be shown for all menu items or not, by default this is set to false, meaning the open button will

        <p class="CodeParagraph">@Input() ShowOnlyIcon: boolean = false;</p>
        <p>This is used to specify whether the title should be shown or not. It is basically used when the menu is
          collapsed and only icons are needed to be shown. So, if you have something where a small menu (width) is
          supposed to be shown on a mobile screen, this option is for you.u</p>
